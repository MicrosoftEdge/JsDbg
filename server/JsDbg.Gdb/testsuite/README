To run these tests, first install dejagnu: https://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/
You can install it using "apt-get install dejagnu" or "yum install dejagnu".

Then run "runtest" in this directory.

If tests fail, look at "jsdbg.log" for details, or run "runtest -v -v -v"
for more verbose output, or run "runtest --debug" and check dbg.log for
more details.
